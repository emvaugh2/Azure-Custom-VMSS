# Using Custom Images for a Virtual Machine Scale Set in Azure

**There are 4 objectives with this lab:**
* Start Cloud Shell
* Set Resource Variables in Cloud Shell
* Create an Image from the VM
* Create a Virtual Machine Scale Set from an Image


## Start Cloud Shell

In the first part of the lab, we need to create our new storage account. We've been through this plenty of times so go create a new storage account. I named mine `evstorageaccount5` and clicked create.

That completes the first half of this lab!



## Set Resource Variables in Cloud Shell

For the second portion of this lab, we're going to actually start doing the backups. So firstly, lets go into the pre-configured storage account. Lets navigate to the file share that we are attempting to backup to our new file share, `fileshare1`.

Lab completed!

## Personal Notes

Another straightforward lab. It was nice seeing another way of backing up data. You can never be too careful!
